bob works for the famous apple company, he has been a computer programmer
for quite a long time. his favorite language is cobol, but he can also
program in the modern language python. he is an active learner when needed.
bob thinks that generating and storing a random salt value for each userid
is a waste. instead, he is proposing that his system administrators use a
cryptographic hash of the userid as its salts choices certainly impacts the
salted passwords. bob has quite a few pet animals, one dog, one zebra and 
quite a few snakes, includeing two pythons. he loves the zebra and the dog,
but he hates snakes and especially pythons. occasionally, he brings a box of
chocolates to feed the zebra. his kids, on the other hand, loves snakes
and pythons

this is more on bob and his family. bob has four kids, three
daughters and one son. his son is jealous about indoor sports,
especially badminton. but all his daughters love outdoor sports,
except indoor swimming. I have to say that bob is a family guy and
is quite trustable.
